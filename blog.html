                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programms For 2023</h2>
                <p>University is the place where we spend most of the time of our childhood until we make a transition into a college. We are given an educational certificate for the commencement of our education at the school. This certificate is issued by the school signed by the Block Education Officer, or by the educational board to which the school is affiliated.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A certificate of student status, or student certificate, is a certificate that is usually from your university, which proves that you are on a course there right now. It can contain your details, university details, your course details, the dates of study, and whether you are studying full time or part time. The main use of this is due to students enrolled on a course receiving exemptions from council tax. This certificate proves that the holder is a student.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Many universities have an online system where you can request and receive your certificate automatically, or have it sent to you after it has been processed. For example, you can find where to request your certificate and more information about this using this page for the University of Coventry and this page for the University of Birmingham.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If students want to gain exemption from paying council tax, they will need to provide proof. This comes in the form of the student certificate.
                  Providing this proof will allow the student access to exemptions to council tax, which will help the students a lot when managing their money. To find out whether students have to pay other taxes, you can click on this link to a Think Student article.</p>
